 * READ/WRITE_LAMPS take data_count records of four words [x,y,state,reserved],

 * that many independent pulses (zero defaults to one), committed atomically.
 * TRIGGER.flags bit 0 invokes HitSwitch (normalizing multi-tile objects); zero
 * directly pulses the rectangle. TICKS advances the 60 Hz mechanical scheduler.
 * Cancelling or failing either command restores all of its circuit state.
 * SAVE writes one WLD to a distinct source_id; aux_source_id must be zero. Its
 * final READY has result_kind=TCW_SAVE, result_count=WLD bytes, reserved=0.

 * It returns only actual retained pixel tiles, sorted x then y; non-pixel cells
 * are absent. Records match VIEWPORT's 16-byte layout. Wire masks derive from
 * compiled ports; frames derive from the live pixel state. No source rescan,
 * CPU decode, display-controller shortcut or framebuffer write is performed. */
/* OPTIMIZATION uses mask=0 (vanilla pixel rule and per-trip mask clear,
 * default) or 1 (generation dedup and WireHead-style ordinary PixelBox pairing
 * across TripWire calls in the same gate wave). Only an idle boundary accepts
 * the switch; switching itself preserves pixel frames, ROM/RAM, input and RNG.
 * Both modes retain compiled topology and lazy lamps. Enabling returns
 * TCW_UNSUPPORTED without changing state when a pixel's same-colour connected
 * H/V axes have distinct networks that WireHead would merge. No-pixel worlds
 * remain supported. This is not an unrestricted WireHead topology emulator. */

 * Exact frame layouts must come from the target game's TileObjectData or its
 * procedural frame checks, never a rendered atlas. Later requests reuse the index.

 * Tile flags bits 0..6: active, actuator, inactive, invisible block/wall,
 * fullbright block/wall. Frame coordinates are signed 16-bit values.
 * EXTRACT flags bit 0: emit a COB1 object companion to aux_source_id using
 * sequential WRITE events, then the original cell RESULT. width limits bytes
 * (32..4194304); height limits objects (1..32768). Requires the numeric
 * circuitWorld.fragmentObjects=1 capability. No implicit empty inventories.
